# Battleships-solver
Solver of battleships game in the least number of steps in Kotlin.

Written as solution in the CodingArena 2023 Battleships competition. 

I removed all the code for api communication and special powers in that competition so that it works on its own outside of that competition.

TODO: 
- random level generation (different field sizes and numbers of ships). Right now there is only one hard-coded level (but solver can solve any level with correct placement of ships)
- some optimization

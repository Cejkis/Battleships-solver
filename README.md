# Battleships-solver
Solver of battleships game in the least number of steps in Kotlin. Levels are randomly generated.

Written as solution in the CodingArena 2023 Battleships competition. I removed all the code for api communication and special powers in that competition so that it works on its own outside of that competition.

TODO:
- optimization of the search algorithm

This code was written without the use of LLMs
